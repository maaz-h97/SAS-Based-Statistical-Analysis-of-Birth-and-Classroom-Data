# SAS-Based-Statistical-Analysis-of-Birth-and-Classroom-Data
This project demonstrates comprehensive statistical analysis using SAS programming. The study utilizes a large real-world birth dataset (50,000 records) and a behavioral classroom dataset.

## About the Project
This project showcases applied statistical analysis using the SAS programming language. The analysis covers two datasets:

- **Birth Data:** 50,000 records with attributes like baby's weight, mother's smoking habits, marital status, maternal weight gain, education level, etc.
- **Classroom Data:** Comparative study of cooperation and competition levels among students.

The project demonstrates the application of:
- **T-Tests:** To compare means between groups (e.g., smoking vs non-smoking mothers)
- **Correlation Analysis:** To study relationships between continuous variables like maternal age, cigarettes per day, weight gain, etc.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Means, variances, skewness, and kurtosis for behavior analysis.
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Interpretation of statistical significance in the real-world context.

- The project highlights:

Hypothesis testing with T-Tests (e.g., Mother's smoking habits, marital status, baby's gender affecting birth weight)
Correlation and central tendency analysis
SAS procedures like PROC IMPORT, PROC TTEST, PROC CORR, PROC MEANS
Analytical interpretation of large-scale datasets in healthcare and education domains.
